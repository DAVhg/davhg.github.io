There were also major changes made to the core components of the operating system, such as moving from a mainly cooperatively multitasked 16-bit architecture to a 32-bit preemptive multitasking architecture, at least when running only 32-bit protected mode applications. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign, Windows 95 introduced numerous functions and features that were featured in later Windows versions, such as the taskbar, the &#8220;Start&#8221; button and the ways the user could navigate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years after its introduction, Windows 95 was succeeded by Windows 98. Microsoft ended extended support for Windows 95 on December 31, 2001. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>^ Text source: Wikipedia.org.
