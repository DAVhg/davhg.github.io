The first handheld in the Game Boy family, it was first released in Japan on April\u00a021,\u00a01989,  then North America, three months later, and lastly in Europe, nearly a  year after. It was designed by the same team that developed the Game &amp; Watch and several Nintendo Entertainment System games: Satoru Okada, Gunpei Yokoi, and Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\tThis is a left side pull-quote created with a shortcode<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nintendo&#8217;s second handheld game console, the Game Boy combines  features from both the NES home system and Game &amp; Watch hardware.  The console features a dull green dot-matrix screen with adjustable contrast dial, five control buttons (a directional pad, two game buttons, and &#8220;start&#8221; and &#8220;select&#8221;), a single speaker with adjustable volume dial, and, like its rivals, uses cartridges as physical media for games. The color scheme is made from two tones of grey with accents of black, blue, and dark magenta.  All the corners of the portrait-oriented rectangular unit are softly  rounded, save for the bottom right, which is curved. At launch, it was  sold either as a standalone unit, or bundled with one of several games, namely Super Mario Land or Tetris. Several accessories were also developed, including a carrying pouch and printer. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\tThis is a right side pull-quote created with a shortcode<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being technologically inferior to its fourth-generation competitors (Sega&#8217;s Game Gear, Atari&#8217;s Lynx, and NEC&#8217;s TurboExpress), the Game Boy received praise for its battery life and durability in its construction. It quickly outsold the competition, selling one million units in the United States within a few weeks. The Game Boy and its successor, the Game Boy Color, have sold an estimated 118 million units worldwide. It is one of the most recognizable devices from the 1990s, becoming a cultural icon in the years following its release. Several redesigns were released during the console&#8217;s lifetime, including the Game Boy Pocket in 1996 and the Game Boy Light in 1998 (Japan only). Production of the Game Boy continued into the early 2000s, even after the release of its successor, the Game Boy Advance, in 2001. Production ceased in 2003.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>^ Text source: Wikipedia.org.
