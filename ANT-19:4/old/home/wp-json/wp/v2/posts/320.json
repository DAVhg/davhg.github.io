At this time, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and Windows NT 3.1 were still in development and Microsoft&#8217;s plan for the future was focused on Cairo. Cairo would be Microsoft&#8217;s next-generation operating system based on  Windows NT and featuring a new user interface and an object-based file  system, but it was not planned to be shipped before 1994 (Cairo would  eventually partially ship in July 1996 in the form of Windows NT 4.0, but without the object-based file system, which would later evolve into WinFS). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simultaneously with Windows 3.1&#8217;s release, IBM started shipping OS\/2 2.0.  Microsoft realized they were in need of an updated version of Windows  that could support 32-bit applications and preemptive multitasking, but  could still run on low-end hardware (Windows NT did not). So the  development of Windows &#8220;Chicago&#8221; was started and, as it was planned for a  late 1993 release, became known as Windows 93. Initially, the decision  was made not to include a new user interface, as this was planned for  Cairo, and only focus on making installation, configuration, and  networking easier. Windows 93 would ship together with MS-DOS 7.0,  offering a more integrated experience to the user and making it  pointless for other companies to create DOS clones. MS-DOS 7.0 was in  development at that time under the code name &#8220;Jaguar&#8221; and could  optionally run on top of a Windows 3.1-based 32-bit protected mode  kernel called &#8220;Cougar&#8221; in order to better compete with DR-DOS. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>^ Text source: Wikipedia.org.
