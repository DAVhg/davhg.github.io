## Why Isaac Asimov's Laws of Robotics Don't Work

Today I want to talk about how the Isaac Asimov's Laws of Robotics dont work and they can't be used to prevent an ASI that can harm humans.

In that first sentence I already told the problem, and that is the terms 'harm' and 'humans', but first, we need to know which are the three laws of robotics and who Isaac Asimov was.

Isaac Asimov was a science-fiction writer, with many famous books like I, Robot in which he introduced the three laws:

(from Wikipedia):

The Three Laws of Robotics (often shortened to The Three Laws or known as Asimov's Laws) are a set of rules devised by the science fiction author Isaac Asimov. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story "Runaround" (included in the 1950 collection I, Robot), although they had been foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws, quoted as being from the "Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.", are:

<h2 id="heading-two">First Law</h2>
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

<h2 id="heading-two">Second Law</h2>
A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

<h2 id="heading-two">Third Law</h2>
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
