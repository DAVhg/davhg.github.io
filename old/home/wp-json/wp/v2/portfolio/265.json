The concrete is left unfinished or roughly-finished after casting and it remains exposed visually. The final surface often shows the forms and structures of the formwork.<\/p>\n<p>The best known proto-Brutalist architecture is the work of the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, in particular his 1952 Unit\u00e9 d&#8217;habitation in France and the 1953 Secretariat Building (Palace of Assembly) in Chandigarh, India. Brutalism gained considerable momentum in the United Kingdom during the mid-twentieth century, as economically depressed (and World War II-ravaged) communities sought inexpensive construction and design methods for low-cost housing, shopping centres, and government buildings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\tThis is a left side pull-quote created with a shortcode<\/div>\n<p>Nonetheless, many architects chose the Brutalist style even when they had large budgets, as they appreciated the &#8216;honesty&#8217;, the sculptural qualities, and perhaps, the uncompromising, anti-bourgeois, nature of the style.<\/p>\n<p>The use of b\u00e9ton brut was pioneered by Auguste Perret and other modern architects. It was used in such buildings as Unit\u00e9 d&#8217;Habitation in the early part of the twentieth century. It flourished as a part of the brutalist architecture of the 1960s and 70s.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\tThis is a right side pull-quote created with a shortcode<\/div>\n<p>This largely gave way to structural expressionism as steel structures became more advanced and viable. Wood-imprinted concrete is still very popular in landscaping especially in some of the western European countries.<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/Work\/w95theme.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/david-rangel-4m7gmLNr3M0-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16\"><\/p>\n<p>Exposed concrete surfaces can be varied with different formwork shetting (e.g. board shuttering, smooth formwork, form liner, form moulds, filter fleeces) or with surface processing techniques (e.g. washed concrete surfaces, photo concrete, acidified surfaces).[1] Particularly high quality poured concrete, achieved by leaving enough room between the formwork and the reinforcing bars for the concrete to flow freely, is called Sichtbeton in German, cemento a vista in Italian. This translates roughly into &#8220;concrete for viewing.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As of version 19.05.09, 8Bit theme includes highlighter.js for code snippets formatting.
